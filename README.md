# Machine-learning airplanes

Welcome to my Machine-Learning Airplane Game!

In this game, you take control of an airplane and navigate through a challenging checkpoint course. You will compete against [machine-learned](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Machine_learning) airplanes, which have been trained to navigate the course.
With intuitive controls, you will guide your airplane through the course, trying to beat the best time set by the AI-controlled airplanes.
Get ready to take flight and test your skills in this exciting game of aviation and AI competition!
